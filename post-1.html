    Prompt: First, what 3 lessons did you learn from Henry Chao about how to either identify a failed IT project or signal to leadership that an IT project was failing. Do any of these lessons relate to frameworks or theories you have learned in other HKS classes? (for example, Fagan’s Operations Management class) Who do you think is responsible for those failures and how, had you been part of the development team, might you have alerted HHS to these possible failures. (suggested word count 600-1000 words)

        <p>Henry's talk was both clarifying in several ways, and validating in others. What seemed most unintuitive but resoundingly clear was that the failure surrounding the project of healthcare.gov was not a technical failure, but rather a cultural and organizational failure. Henry mentioned immediately <span class="inline-quote">"you don't want to cry wolf…people don't want to hear about the doom and gloom in an already toxic environment."</span> This furnished the idea that despite Henry's continued effort to notify his team of the dangers inherent to the project, the environment was not receptive to it and could not adjust to fit the realities of the project. By October 2010, most of the attention surrounding the ACA went to the centerpiece - the major policy crux of the ACA, rather than its technical implementation and realization. With political stress, and Obama's election campaign around the corner, the optics of the situation limited the opportunity for full transparency of the project's major stresses. Once the policy was made, the <span class="italic">important</span> part was over. The lack of visibility to CIO/CTO roles and their lack of a seat at the table relegated the project of healthcare.gov to an after-the-fact liminal space, and outed the technical implementers and architects of this thorny system as outsiders. Compounded on this was a series of continually changing requirements, an obvious need to for testing without the time to actually do it, and an ambitious timeline with risk-averse stakeholders (like the SSA and IRS that are already hard to build with). </p>
        <br>
        <p>With only 17 months to agree on a full strategy on ACLs and data management, and an unclear set of user flows that were critical to the success of healthcare.gov, it was clear that this 42-month project was destined for major challenges from its infancy. But the path to political success and public support is paved with yes-men and those who stand in the way do not get carried to the finish line.</p>

        <p>"Just picture a pig in a python," Henry mentioned while describing the launch. </p>

        <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Identify a Failed/Failing IT Project</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Establish a culture that understands that failure is inevitable.</strong><br>
                This is incredibly fundamental to the issues at the center of healthcare.gov. It seems that even though critical failures were identified and clear to those involved in the trenches of the project, there was no one who could actually hear these grievances or respond to them. Failure was simply not an option and this is not how implementations of hairy projects like these tend to go. Henry said "a lot of large organizations have not done well with the big bang theory." Though Henry wanted a limited rollout with incremental releases, this was simply not possible given the structure of the project and the immense pressure to meet the launch date. People should not be excluded from conversations for vocalizing failures, and omitting these voices will make the implementers at the helm of projects like these completely ignorant, and unaware of the realities of their projects, fully unprepared to grapple with any challenges that arise when they inevitably do.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Build in time to address potential failures.</strong><br>
                Apart from establishing a culture that allows failure to be discussed, there should be ways of actually addressing it, once it is clear and present (and hopefully, even before that!). As we discussed in class, designating a full schedule to a project works best in situations where the environment and project rests on predictability, validated assumptions and high stability. In this case, and in others, several pieces of the project were not fully understood when the Gantt chart needed to be drawn, and if time was cut out from the development of one part of this waterfall strategy, it simply had no place to be reintroduced later. Of course, this project also had an extremely ambitious (read: nearly impossible) timeline which made building in time for testing, and limited rollouts also structurally impossible, even if that was of interest.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Understand the scope of the project and its implementation from voices that are in the loop.</strong><br>
                This point also is in line with the other two but cannot be underscored enough. Henry repeatedly spoke about how the voices of CIOs/CTOs were often relegated to the "kids table" and that because they were not part of the policy centerpiece, that they were seen as outsiders. Without a direct voice about the status of the project to higher-ups (or without those higher-ups notifying the right people as was assumed), accurate knowledge about the project had no way of being passed up in an authentic form. A rift in communication like this prevents news about impending failure (and an actual response) from being addressed or shared. </li><br>
            <br><br>
            <p>Though I do not have an HKS leadership pedagogy to compare these learnings to, I can say as an engineer with private sector expertise that the tacky "fail fast" models do actively promote an environment that encourages transparency. Rather than focusing failure on shifting blame, these environments adaptively address learnings from projects as they unfold, and though these projects also do run on deadlines (like releases with clients), they build in sufficient time to address them and allow for priorities to shift over time. These methods acknowledge that learning is an inevitable part of the process, which is definitely intrinsic to the project of healthcare.gov.</p>
            <p>Had I been a part of this project, and alerted the HHS, I honestly do not think I could have mounted a significant impact on anything. Instead of simply notifying the HHS of the impending failure, I think my best shot at improving the project would have been to create a list of potential outcome scenarios, and find the people in upper administration that are most receptive to this kind of information (maybe those who understand the challenges of the project or those who have had a history of leading large technical projects that needed to actually address failure). This situation did not seem like it would be receptive to any canary-in-a-coalmine kind of response from the implementing team, but I wonder if a lot of the folks on the project threatened to leave could have increased the visibility of the magnitude of the issues at hand.</p>
