		<p>Borders and border security is all the rage these days. They’re the subject of our record-setting government shut down, a design phenomenon (slats or no slats?) and the cornerstone of an aggressive and growing project that has had a much longer history before Trump’s presidency ushered the most recent wave of national attention to the subject. From what started as a tenuous line drawn in the sand across border towns in the US-Mexico border to a 6-foot wall constructed in Nogales after a shootout, to today’s 20 foot steel-beam fences, border security has been a consistently <a href=“https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/01/10/pancho-villa-prostitutes-spies-us-mexico-border-walls-wild-origins/?utm_term=.f697138b5396”>incrementally advancing effort</a>. </p>

		<p>The Secure Border Initiative, launched in 2006 under the auspices of the DHS (Secretary Chertoff) with CBP, ICE, USCIS, and the USCG. Together, these agencies were tasked with building a virtual border wall - a modern system to facilitate in the transfer of information to engage border patrol in more proactive and directed efforts in advancing border security along the Sonoran Desert in Arizona. With 9 80-foot control towers distributed across a section of the border, each furnished in cameras and sensors and communications networks to relay data about trespassers, the entire system was meant to deploy border patrol in a more intelligent way to respond to real emergent and detected threats. This project — the virtual border — was called SBInet, or the Secure Border Initiative Network. </p>

		<p>Bush <a href=“http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/08/AR2009050802064.html”>charted a five-year plan</a> with an initial projection of $7.6 billion for the project, though it was soon reduced to $6.7 billion because of the descoping of the project by eliminated the Texas section. Boeing was designated as the main contractor in the project, awarded $1.15 million of funding from 2006 to August 2008 to realize the project. Other subcontractors like Ross Perot’s Perot Systems were also engaged in the project, leading to a team of around 240 people implementing this virtual border. In an <a href=“https://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2010/february/i_bds01.pdf”>article</a> published by Boeing about the project, the DHS was asking if the project was moving in the right direction by February 2010.</p>
		<br> <span class="quote">”The Department of Homeland Security recently announced that the SBInet program will undergo a departmentwide reassessment that will include an evaluation of the right balance of SBInet technology, physical fence and Border Patrol agents required to provide control along the southern border.”</span>

	<p>Building the SBInet was a demanding and unconventional project - not only was it already a heavy physical labor because of its magnitude and scale, but the project was along a strenuous land barrier in the middle of a desert, often detached from existing technical infrastructures to adequately handle telecommunications. In the same <a href=“https://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2010/february/i_bds01.pdf”>Boeing report</a>, the SBInet operations and production manager states “Extremely hot weather—not to mention monsoons, snakes, tarantulas and the occasional mountain lion sighting—demand extra vigilance and attention to safety, coordination and communication.” Compounded over spotty cell phone coverage, geographic distance from the main office and resources, the extreme weather in both summer and winter, and the sheer scale of the border (over 225 square miles in the first deployment), the project was in no shortage of technical and physical challenges.</p>

	<p>The project was built in cycles of deployment - the first deployment was completed by February 2010, and the next was on the horizon. But within a month, the project was pulled, with Janet Napolitano diverting the $50 million dollars of stimulus funds initially designated for this project to others instead. In one report, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson called the SBInet a “grave and expensive disappointment.” <br><br>Napolitano said, <span class="quote"> “Not only do we have an obligation to secure our borders, we have a responsibility to do so in the most cost-effective way possible … the system of sensors and cameras along the Southwest border known as SBInet has been plagued with cost overruns and missed deadlines.”</span></p>

	<p> Several issues were raised in the months that followed, directing clarity at the failures of the SBInet. Ranging from budget issues, to scope, to testing failures, to organizational challenges in managing the project, SBInet evidently failed on many fronts. Congressional Democrats pointed out that the deployment would take three years longer than initially projected, and that without a budget confirmed for the second phase and a reduction in the budget for the first, it would be difficult to implement the rest of the program. Senator Joseph Liberman (I-Conn) who was then the secretary of the Senate homeland security committee mentioned that the DHS had already spent $3.4 billion recently on border fencing, and that an additional $6.7 billion was not the right solution for this uncertain implementation. </p>

	<p>With a such a varied cluster of identified issues, its unclear how to allocate blame in this situation, and how a clearer solution might have emerged in this version of SBInet’s place. A <a href=“https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-651T”>GAO report</a> from May 2010 concurs - “Since the inception of SBInet, GAO has reported on a range of issues regarding design and implementation, including program challenges, management weaknesses, and cost, schedule, and performance risks; DHS has largely concurred with GAO's recommendations and has started to take some action to address them.” However, reporting from the GAO seemed to hover over two key issues. The first was on the expenditure schedule of the project, and how the lack of secured funding to continue rollout threatened the development of the project, leading to continuous descoping and fundamental limits on what the program could accomplish. With the continued testing of the overall system in progress, the number of issues that surfaced outpaced the contractor’s ability to resolve them and push forward with the rest of the remaining implementation. In <a href=“https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-6”>a more mature report</a> by the GAO from October of 2010,  other issues like a lack of specificity in the requirements of such a system and suboptimal resource allocation were also identified.  A Washington Post retrospective on SBInet also mentioned that the project rested on inaccurate assumptions - “Boeing initially relied on police dispatching software that was not able to process the vast flow of information streaming from the desert, and other technical problems plagued cameras and radar.” Other issues might have been raised earlier had auditing been performed <a href=“https://fcw.com/articles/2017/02/16/dhs-oig-border-wall-oversight.aspx”>as initially expected</a> through a lifecycle audit (continuously auditing the project throughout, rather than only at key milestones).</p>

	<p>While the project of securing the border and limited crime in these liminal areas remains a clear focus of Trump’s presidency, the question of how this enormous task will be realized with bipartisan allies across the isles remains unclear. Who will pay? Probably not Mexico.</p>
