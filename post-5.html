            When Julia Gutierrez and the Massachusetts Digital Service Team visited DPI 671M, they mentioned that the Mass Digital Service team’s theory of change is top-down. They have worked on developing <a href=“https://medium.com/massgovdigital/mass-gov-building-a-wicked-awesome-new-website-for-massachusetts-ede5f43913f”>wicked awesome</a> services that make front-ends more navigable and user friendly, using a core set of packages that many other website owners across mass.gov could adopt into their own development cycle. In many ways, this theory of change makes sense. For users, watching this new interface proliferate across services could generate much more joy and a reduction of friction in their experiences, which could in turn build trust and support between constituents and government.  The positive feedback and quicker adoption of these services could incentivize mass.gov to broadly adopt the Mass Digital Service’s work, and give them good standing as partners in digital transformation with many other teams. This Trojan horse method limits hostility from other teams, and creates a desirable product that can proliferate first and then expand slowly.

            The MA Digital Service is part of the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security (EOTSS) within MA. Because EOTSS provides IT for several MA departments, it already is an essential endpoint to many teams and already has an existing relationship with them which cannot be bypassed. By providing a <strong>necessary service</strong>, EOTSS already maintains a captive audience within the MA government. This may strategically position the MA Digital Service with the ability to reach other teams well, but only if the prior existing relationships with EOTSS were positive (<span class=“italic”>I’m not sure how to check this</span>).

            One interesting thing about EOTSS is that it works on developing both internally facing and external constituent-facing services. This balance of internal/external is something I personally want to dive deeper into understanding, because it would be worthwhile to see if the incumbent internal tools influence the external ones, and if the UX brought to bear on constituent services influence the quality of the internally facing ones too. From personal experience working at other tech companies, the companies that baked design into their processes were always a joy to work at because internal tools were incredibly usable and frictionless. This definitely worked positively towards retaining employees who felt cared for, and empowered to be more productive in meaningful ways (rather than being bogged down by tasks that don’t actually require the skillsets that they are experts at).

            <h3>Things that are working well:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inclusion and Diversity</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is abundantly clear that even in the details, the Mass Digital Service is trying to serve a broader audience. From writing at a <a href=“https://medium.com/massgovdigital/why-we-write-at-a-6th-grade-level-8f11b08ae65”>6th grade reading level</a> to including <a href=“https://www.mass.gov/orgs/ma-digital-service”>women of different racial backgrounds</a> on their website, the team itself is creating a more inclusive environment. It’s hard to tell how this culturally affects the applicants to the MA Digital Service’s internship program and hiring, but attention is certainly visible in the details.</li></ul>
            <li><strong>Creating value for a diversity of services</strong><ul>
                <li>From case studies like <a href=“https://medium.com/massgovdigital/how-video-affects-page-performance-results-from-our-pilot-project-7ea120e1a9c5”>this one</a> that look into click and completion rates for videos embedded on MA websites, it is clear that the MA Digital Service is working with other groups in MA (in this case, the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (MassWildlife) ) to gather data from different sources to increase their sample size of data. Through collaborations like this, the MA Digital Service is able to generate value for nearly all teams that use videos on their pages to see how they can improve engagement, while also strengthening relationships in the process. </li>
                <li>These instructional case studies also consistently offer help for teams that are interested in improving their services. See <a href=“https://medium.com/massgovdigital/how-mass-gov-designers-run-usability-tests-9e157396ed55”>this article</a>, for example, which includes this invitation: <span class="quote"> “Do you want to learn more about how to conduct your own usability test? Reach out to us on Twitter and let us know what you are working on.”</span></li>
                <li>The <a href=“https://medium.com/massgovdigital/custom-dashboards-surfacing-data-where-mass-gov-authors-need-it-80616c97dff4”>dashboard</a> is another example of the creation of a service that broadly benefits the MA government, providing a tool that will retain internal users. Even in its development, the MA Digital Service included 5 other partner agencies to work on testing to identify what this dashboard should provide and see what kind of information it could surface. I can’t tell how many currently use this product, but its a good example of something that is broadly applicable and constructive across the board.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Other feedback:</h3><ul>
                <li><strong>Long Term Strategy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>From this blog post, it looks like the long term strategy here is to continue digitizing more services and increasing the traffic that the MA Digital Service intercepts through their interventions with other partner agencies. This strategy has already provided strong progress (clearly) considering they have already met more than 90% of the traffic of <a href=“ma.gov”>MA.gov</a> domains, but also points to a fundamental limit in the MA Digital Service’s ability to effect change. This places the MA Digital Service as a central bottleneck in digital transformation — are there enough resource to continue to partner with agencies as these transformations happen? And how can agencies work using the guidelines/methods of the MA Digital Service without requiring that the digital service is involved in implementation to reduce the bottleneck? If the MA Digital Service’s goal is to transform every service themselves, this could limit the impact of the digital service. The MA Digital Service also offers office hours by sign-up, but these are still limiting in that they require the MA Digital Service’s intervention. In class we discussed a digital service (Ontario) where a potential ideal future is that the digital service does not exist, because the entire government has adopted a unified system with standardized protocols + schemas. At least for the track that the MA Digital Service is on, it seems like this is not an end goal nor is it a feasible one. </li>
                <li>I am not sure about this, but are there standardized data schemas and system architectures that the MA Digital Service suggests that can infiltrate the backends of the underlying systems? I assume this kind of strategy can be the next phase of the Trojan horse. Can the front-end packages and services start pushing for data to be presented in a certain way that influences the way the backends and architectures of systems are designed to create a more lasting and codified change in digital services? I imagine that for posterity, if something does threaten the power or posture of the MA Digital Service, that this kind of impact will provide a lot of groundwork to keep these services running smoothly. Maybe this kind of threat/risk model is not necessary though, because of the MA Digital Service’s good standing with partner agencies. One of the MA Digital Service’s FY 19 goals was along this line of thinking, but I wonder how specifically it will work.<div class="quote">“Develop data infrastructure, maintain data layers and implement data sharing business processes necessary to deliver successful analytics projects that have a meaningful impact”</div>While this does demonstrate a strong data strategy, a lot of the data that the MA Digital Service handles is data that it also generates, like web analytics and usability research data. How does this strategy apply to the existing data that probably has not changed for years that underlying services are using?</li>
