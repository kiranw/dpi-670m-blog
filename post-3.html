    In a blog post, identify an organization you would like to use for your final assignment.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="smaller">Write a few sentences about: <br>
        <span class="smaller"><strong>Why does this organization need some form of digital transformation? EG:</strong><br>
        Is an internal or external user need not being met<br>
        Are there large expenditures on IT<br>
        Is there a large project that failed<br>
        Are core activities not being performed effectively<br>
        <strong>What is your hypothesis about why the organization cannot transform?<br>
        What would a successful transformation look like?</strong><br>

    <p class="textbox">I think this is true not only for the Boston or Cambridge government, but a pattern I have noticed across several government websites at the local level. Local governments often lack the ability to build and manage their own technical infrastructures, and instead use procurement to find vendors to build out separate components of their websites over time. By this token, the websites turn into a patchwork of different user experiences, different standards and expected user flows, and in general, a lot of friction. Even with a technically functional product, these websites still do not meet their primary goal: developing a public forum and public space that feels comfortable inhabitable to all, that maintains confidence and trust in its underlying system. An external user need is not being met.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="textbox">I'll specifically discuss Boston and Cambridge (as a continuation of my last post). The Cambridge government hosts its website on <a href="https://cambridgema.gov">cambridgema.gov</a>. This website has a generally modern front-end, with sections devoted to services, press releases, news, FAQs and notices, among other useful information. But when It comes to digging deeper into each of these, a user may quickly notice that the interface changes dramatically. </p>
    <br>

    <p class="textbox">Here's that interface on the home page at play: </p>
    <iframe class="box-shadow" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aClYze-qDo&autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="textbox">It's clear that Cambridge has invested in trying to modernize its platform. It's even clearer when scrolling through the history of Cambridge's front end. Here is a reductive view of it over the last decade through the Wayback Machine's caches of the website over time. Even early on, services like online bill payment were offered which put Cambridge ahead of many city governments, but only until recently did it try to modernize its platform. </p>
    <br>

    <iframe class="box-shadow" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qc-epS9ru2g&autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="textbox">Even so, many deeper parts of Cambridge's interface are residues of the past that do not reflect the way people today consume information. <a href="https://www.municode.com/
">Municode</a> is one major vendor that many city governments use to publish their City Codes and Ordinances. It attempts to version control the code, and at least provide links to different section to improve its legibility, but because of the lack of continuity in the interface, and the lack of translation from the legal context that a Code originates, this section of the website does not necessarily serve to inform the public, barring those with some subject domain expertise or an interest to learn more despite the language barrier. Municode's <a href="https://www.municode.com/#codification
">online codification services</a> are only a small part of its offerings. Municode offers online payment platforms, front-ends, meeting management, and codification services. But for Cambridge, its codification services are the only ones that are used. </p>
    <br>
    <img class="sire-img" src="img/municode.png">

    <p class="textbox">As expected, when different vendors fill in the gaps between different services in a single platform, it is hard to standardize the experience across the platform. </p>
    <br>

    <p class="textbox">Where this problem, in my opinion, grows significantly worse, is when it prevents citizens from being aware and involved in local participation. The Cambridge City Council (just like the Boston City Council) functionally uses a spreadsheet to house its data on Council meetings. Agendas, Meeting Minutes, and metadata like descriptions, dates, times and location are all listed. There is an extremely simple search functionality. Meetings are not able to be shared or saved to calendars, unless a user accesses the redundant page on the Cambridge's site of "Events" (not "Meetings") that also contains council meetings. </p>
    <br>
    <img class="sire-img" src="img/open-meetings.png">
    <p class="textbox">Council meetings can be thoroughly reviewed after the fact through videos, and thorough notes but these are still not legible, and still do not match the Cambridge's other interface. This lack of unity, and fundamentally a lack of what users engaging with the system may benefit from creates a rift. This is a set of digital services that benefits those who are already familiar with how things work, and how to navigate the differing UX neighborhoods contained in this public space. Like Richard Pope mentioned in class, it is important to build conveniences for the citizens, not the government. </p>
    <br>

    <p class="textbox">I think the organization can absolutely transform but is held back by two core issues: </p><Br>
    <p class="textbox"> (1) Vendors fracture a unifying interface if they are not bespoke enough, and when one element is "set" in code, it makes it that much harder to change. Changing the frontend of the main page requires going back to every vendor managing a subcomponent to make cascading updates which is systematically difficult. </p>
    <p class="textbox"> (2) Communication here serves government more than constituents. Changing how we display and share information to something digestible and consumable, knowing that it does not fully capture the legal context or Parliamentary Procedure of the initial meetings. Digital space does not function with the same order as physical meetings, and despite the remote streaming, there is no remote participation. </p>
    <br>

    <p class="textbox">The way we manage streamlining change and understanding what a user really needs can truly revolutionize trust and participation in local governance. A successful transformation will resolve both of these issues. Solving the fractured UX could technically be managed by using a single CSS page, where changes here cascade to all components of the website. This bypasses the need for a vendor to participate in change-making (though surely there will be edge cases that cannot be fully encapsulated by this). As for the second, through my own personal interviews with citizens, navigating these websites for more specific information is often challenging (so much so, that there is attrition). For community organizers, this is less of a challenge because they have become domain experts in navigation. The bias that pursues in who participates destabilized the democracy that we hope tech transformation can enable. </p>
