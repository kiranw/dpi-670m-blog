            In the Boston area, the fracture between the City Council and city’s public domains in digital space is
            clear, and pervasive. Somerville, Cambridge and Boston all implemented their City Council websites around
            the same time, with the same vendors. But each city transformed its website and online services over time,
            leaving the city council websites behind. Services like <a href="http://meetingrecords.cityofboston.gov/sirepub/errorpage.aspx">SIRE</a> do not reflect the way people consume information
            today, and if they are the public’s main interface into seeing how certain issues are managed, people
            might assume that the websites are a reflection of the competence of the council (and this assumption
            is absolutely not true).</p>
        <br>
        <strong>This leaves us with questions of:<br></strong>
        (1) Where and how power flows between the city and council<br>
        (2) Where and how money flows between the city and council<br>
        (3) How might digital services be managed with 2-year terms<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><h3>Power</h3></strong>
        <p class="textbox">I interviewed <a href="http://matthewmclaughlin.nationbuilder.com/">Matt from Somerville Ward
            1</a> and <a href="https://www.benforward3.com/">Ben from Somerville Ward 3</a>. Both mentioned that the job
            of serving on council was an extremely dense job — because of the lack of press, they both manage their own
            <a href="https://www.benforward3.com/newsletter-archive">newsletters</a>, <a href="http://matthewmclaughlin.nationbuilder.com/blog">blogs</a> and mailing lists to keep citizens informed. These end up being privately managed and people
            can add themselves through <a href="https://www.benforward3.com/mailinglist">registration links online</a>, if they know to look. Ben is a postdoc at Harvard
            Medical School and Matthew serves in Cambridge full-time. Between full-time jobs and the council, they
            also find it difficult to imagine building in extra capacity to improve things. While they see the importance
            of digital services, there are several other tasks that would claim priority if more resources were to
            flow into the council. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="textbox">Though Matt is on the <a href="https://www.somervillema.gov/boa">Finance Committee</a> in
            Somerville, he mentions that it feels like more
            of a supervisory role. Above this, the council defers a lot of their powers to the <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution">State constitution</a>
            which tends to supersede many local initiatives, leaving resources tied into attempting to take cases
            up to acquire state permission (issues like raising taxes, housing transfer tax/affordable housing subsidy,
            etc). Historically, power used to be more present locally but was ceded to commissions housed in the
            Mayor’s office (at least in Somerville). Today, traffic issues are managed by the Traffic/Parking Commission
            managed within the city rather than the council. For important issues where resources are consumed,
            simple websites are constructed to help the public understand the process. This happened for the issue
            with FRIT waives and proposals for <a href="https://www.somervillema.gov/news/city-launch-affordable-housing-program">development near Assembly Row</a>
            but it’s worth noting that these websites are managed by <a href="https://www.somervillema.gov/news">Somerville’s domain</a> and informed by the council.
            There is some overlap between the council and the city, even for tech implementations (but these are
            usually relatively simple static front ends).</p><br>
        <p class="textbox">
            The council’s power, with limits from the State constitution and the budget managed by the Mayor’s office,
            is influenced by another major stake - the public. Realistically, what drives some influence are cogent, strong
            and clear ideas from organizations that care about certain issues. This has been seen from groups of people
            filing for bathrooms in public parks to new bike lanes or crosswalks, to more systemic issues like youth voting
            and affordable housing subsidies. When enough people drum up attention for an issue (you need 12 people to
            petition on an issue for it to trigger the creation of a public hearing), it may receive more attention but
            it is not a guarantee that it will be implemented into practice.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Ultimately, issues are handled if they:</strong><br>
        (1) have support from the council<br>
        (2) there is budget in the Mayor’s allocations<br>
        (3) people can support it publicly to put pressure on it<br>
        (4) there is an infrastructure to handle the situation<br>

        <br><br>
        <strong><h3>Money</h3></strong>
        <p class="textbox">
            The city councils in this area manage their small budgets tightly, and independently from the Mayor’s
            office which is responsible for most of the city’s budget. There is a structural divide. This means
            that when the city executes technology procurement, it is only used for the city itself. So, for example,
            if Boston wanted to redesign its online service portal, the transferrable components that could also
            help the city council will not actually be reused there, too. The city councils end up falling behind
            as a result. This is exceptionally clear now, where the differences between these portals are in high
            contrast. While the councils do manage committees on Finance, and can strike down the Mayor’s budget
            allocations, some working within describe this power as extremely limited. Allocating a higher budget
            to a digital services team just for a council is extremely infeasible.<br><br><br></p>
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <p class="textbox">
            City councils are also resource-strapped in other ways. Council members in Somerville have day jobs,
            and volunteer to serve on the council, pushing many work nights past 11 because of the frequency of
            meetings in the area (and some hearings run far over time, even up to 6 hours!). Some council members
            also serve across cities, like Matthew McLaughlin who serves full-time on the Cambridge council and
            volunteers in Somerville Ward 1 where he lives. It is unlikely that there are folks on the council
            who could manage an entire stack, nor is it reasonable to assume that people with backgrounds in
            computer science will always be elected.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textbox">
            <a href="https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/imce-uploads/2019-04/04152019_city_record.pdf">Technology procurement</a> in the area is classified as an infrastructural investment, and each local
            council actually does manage their current platform with different vendors (like<a href="https://www.hyland.com/en/government/sire">SIRE</a>)
            but these are currently in O&M mode and do not consume many resources. Other vendors like <a href="https://library.municode.com/ma/cambridge/codes/code_of_ordinances">Municode</a> also
            manage parts of the city website though these are through the mayor’s office.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>To summarize:</strong><br>
        (1) City councils do not formally allocate budget<br>
        (2) The Mayor’s office manages the money<br>
        (3) Resources are very finite and some budget does exist for digital services, though limited (and not great for high cap intensity)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><h3>Churn</h3></strong>
        <p class="textbox">City council members serve 2 year terms. In Somerville, they are elected by district/ward with 4 at-large members, while in Cambridge, elections happen through a city-wide ranked choice system. As mentioned before, members each take initiative on different committees and are interested in different issues, but there is no guarantee that there will be an advocated for good digital services at anytime (or that it will be prioritized above other places where the city is resource-limited).<br><br><br></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><h3>Theory of Change and Rollout</h3></strong>
        <p class="textbox">
            The Boston area can manage change well when it has support from those with power
            (the Mayor’s office, public pressure and council members to approve), and when resources can be transferred
            (since they are finite, new line items are difficult but massaging existing budget from one place to another
            can work). The payoff of good digital services may be extremely hard to measure since it will have a slow
            ramp-up of social benefits for engagement and participation (which does not create money or measurable
            value, necessarily). Instead, these digital services will need to make the council and city’s jobs easier
            to save time and create savings in people-hours. A better tech alliance between both the council and the
            city can save resources in this way, because making data accessible across both can make the creation of
            a unified public image significantly easier.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textbox">
            Because the Mayor’s office manages most procurements, I think bids for vendors managing technology that
            CAN be applied to both arms of the local government should be used for both. The City Council needs a
            low-maintenance endpoint that can function similarly to what is currently in place (data is being
            entered into the current services, regularly) and can instead be made more accessible. Implementation-wise,
            adding an extra data-endpoint is not technically difficult nor resource intensive at the scale of data that
            is currently in place. There are benefits across both aisles to integrate services, and because of the
            current overlap in some areas, there are already legs for a strategy like this. The council fully supports
            the addition of more resources, especially if it does not require more work on their end
            (who would turn this down?). The Council may view this as ceding power, but given the limited use
            of procurement within the council already, sharing this power with the city will actually increase
            their ability to get things done rather than reduce it.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textbox">
            The City Clerk currently manages meeting minutes and agendas, the primary data being
            managed by the council. The clerk also manages the updating of this data onto online platforms, and
            transitioning this role to updating the data available to an endpoint that can be pulled by the city’s
            integrated digital services can offer an easy transition of people hours from one job to another.
            Instead of creating a new job (which is currently not feasible), transitioning jobs can make this
            implementation possible. Training may be an issue if the clerk is not invested in learning a new platform,
            which enforces the need of good design on any new digital service architectures that are put into place.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textbox">The current city digital services are generally great! Boston has a
            <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/innovation-and-technology">robust innovation team</a>
            devoted to thinking about ways of facilitating tech improvements, and has been pushing Boston’s <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/innovation-and-technology#digital-tools">open data
                initiatives and digital services</a> ahead. On the city’s side, the team and the infrastructure already
            exists for technology. But establishing better communication between the council and the city may
            be challenging if digital services are shared across both, and may also garner some opposition.
            But given the relatively small scale of overlap between both and the generally stable nature of
            the council’s digital presence at the moment, the transition is simple right now. How this may grow more
            complex over time is hard to tell, but at present, it is simple. Through interviews with Boston’s
            Innovation and Technology team, it seems there is buy in to improve this divide, and having advocates may soothe
            the potential issues that arise from this transition.</p>
